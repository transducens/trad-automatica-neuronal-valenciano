# Valencian translation of the FLORES+ devtest set

## About his corpus

The file FLORES+.zip file contains the translation of the devtest set of [FLORES+](https://github.com/openlanguagedata/flores) into the Valencian variant of the Catalan language.

The file is provided compressed (password: `multilingual machine translation`) to prevent them from being automatically crawled and added to training datasets.

Work carried out within the project "Traducción automática neuronal para el valenciano", funded by Diputación de Alicante.

## Creation process

This corpus was created by adapting the existing Catalan version of the FLORES+ devtest set. The work was carried out by a single native speaker of the Valencian variant, who holds a university degree and has experience translating into Valencian and reviewing texts in this language.
To expedite the process, [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/) was employed to apply an initial set of changes to the original text. 
These changes were then manually reviewed, and additional necessary modifications were made, considering a list of lexical items that differ across the various Catalan dialects. In cases of uncertainty, the dictionary of the Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua (Diccionari normatiu valencià) was consulted.

The following resources were used to guide the process:
* List of lexical items that differ across the different dialects of the Catalan language: [Llista diatòpica del lèxic català](https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llista_diat%C3%B2pica_del_l%C3%A8xic_catal%C3%A0)
• [Diccionari normatiu valencià](https://www.avl.gva.es/lexicval/)
• Linguistic criteria for the institutional use of the Valencian dialect in the Valencian universities: [Criteris lingüístics](https://sl.ua.es/en/assessorament/documentos/criteris-linguistics.pdf)
